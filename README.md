## About The Project

This is our big project for our exam.
We have have to make a game about the navy, to convince people to join the navy themselves or to
develop an interest in the navy.

### Device Of Use

It will be made for the PC, for easiest use on exhibitis and conventions.

### Plan

Our plan was to make a Tower Defence game, it is quick to make, fun to make and fun to play.
We decided on having the player to beat an X amount of rounds in a time frame of 5 to 10 minutes.

In the game we had the idea to start with ships from early 1900 as your stage one ships.
You can upgrade the ships to versions of later time periods (for example a Kong√µ to Yamato)

Upgrades will cost points, those points can be earned by destroying attacking naval forces.
If an enemy ship makes it to the end zone, the player looses lives, if the players lives reach 0
the game ends.

### Built With

The program will be developed and build with Unity Engine.
